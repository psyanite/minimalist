# minimalist
All great things are achieved one step at a time.

Stop making ineffective todo list that's just full of things you're just avoiding doing.
Break down tasks into mini-achievements, to gain a sense of progress.
Maintain short lists to reduce overwhelm.
Delete items that are no longer serving you.
Make lists that actually enable you to GET THINGS DONE!
